= How to use the other language files with the Post To CSV? = 

Here is an example for German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set the WP version to the required language and in configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` write `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure that there are files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` in the plugin (the folder languages in the root of the plugin).

3. If there are no such files it will be necessary to copy other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in the both files).

4. The files are edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please load this program, install it, open the file with the help of this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in German.

5. If everything has been done properly all the lines will be in German in the admin panel and on frontend.
